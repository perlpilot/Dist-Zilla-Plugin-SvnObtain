=head1 NAME

Dist::Zilla::Plugin::SvnObtain - obtain files from a subversion repository before building a distribution

=head1 SYNOPSIS

In your F<dist.ini>:

  [SvnObtain]
    ;subdir = url                                       revision
    simile = http://simile-widgets.googlecode.com/svn   1870

  [SvnObtain/path/to/some/other/dir]
    blah = http://svn.example.com/repos/my-project

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Uses L<SVN::Client> to obtain files from a subversion repository for
inclusion in a distribution made with L<Dist::Zilla>.

C<[SvnObtain]> sections in your F<dist.ini> file describe a set of
Subversion repositories that will be downloaded into the current
directory prior to building a distribution. Subdirectories will be
created that correspond to the name of the projects listed in that
section. Optionally, after the URL of the subversion repository, you may
specify a particular revision to check out. If you do not specify a
revision, C<HEAD> will be used. For instance, to include a copy
MIT's simile timeline widget into your distribution, your
F<dist.ini> would contain something like this:

  [SvnObtain]
    simile = http://simile-widgets.googlecode.com/svn

This would create a subdirectory called F<simile> in the current
directory that contains the C<HEAD> revision.

If you do not wish the project directories to be created in the current
directory, you may specify a path relative to the current directory as
part of the section name. For instance, to checkout subversion
repositories into a subdirectory called F<libs/javascript>, the section
name would look like this:

  [SvnObtain/libs/javascript]
    jquery = http://jqueryjs.googlecode.com/svn/trunk
    simile = http://simile-widgets.googlecode.com/svn  2100

If the directory F<libs/javascript> does not exist, each component of
the path will be created as necessary. Once the directory
F<libs/javascript> exists, project directories will be created within it
for F<jquery> and F<simile>. The F<jquery> checkout will be at the HEAD
revision and the F<simile> checkout will be at revision 2100.

If a directory already exists with the same name as the project directory,
L<Dist::Zilla::Plugin::SvnObtain> will attempt to re-use the directory
if it contains a working copy of a subversion repository that is the same
URL as the one specified for that project directory within F<dist.ini>. 
If the directory is not a subversion working copy or the URL is different,
L<Dist::Zilla::Plugin::SvnObtain> will cause L<Dist::Zilla> to exit with
an appropriate error message.
